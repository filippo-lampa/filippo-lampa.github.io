    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>
      My research studies learning and decision-making in complex, evolving environments.
      I am interested in how artificial agents adapt their behavior over time when faced
      with limited information, computational constraints, and changing objectives.
    </p>
    <p>
      A central theme of my work is cooperative and multi-agent learning, with an emphasis
      on coordination, information sharing, and collective performance. I approach these
      problems through adaptive and online learning methods, with applications to
      security-critical systems such as blockchain platforms.
